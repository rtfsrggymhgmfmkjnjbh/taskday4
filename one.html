        In 2013, he signed on to appear in Martin Prakkat's comedy-drama ABCD:
        American-Born Confused Desi in which he made his singing debut with
        "Johnny Mone Johnny". Both the song and the film became popular.[31]
        Though the film received mixed reviews, his performance was well
        received by critics. Sify stated: "It is Dulquer Salmaan's show all the
        way and in all fairness the young actor has given his heart and soul
        into his character."[32] He was also part of Amal Neerad's segment
        Kullante Bharya in the anthology film 5 Sundarikal (2013).[33] Salmaan
        then collaborated with Sameer Thahir in Neelakasham Pachakadal Chuvanna
        Bhoomi (2013), a road film.[34][35] Salmaan starred in his "first love
        story", cinematographer Alagappan's romantic drama Pattam Pole (2013),
        which was a commercial failure.

        In 2009, his father found him an offer to play the lead role in a film
        to be produced by Sathya Jyothi Films and directed by Badri Venkatesh.
        Titled Baana Kaathadi, the film launched in March 2009 and had Atharvaa
        pair up with fellow rookie actress Samantha. Portraying a youngster from
        the Royapuram slum area, he stayed in the locality for forty-five days
        to learn about the lifestyle, while he also learned to fly a kite for
        the film, canning scenes at the Gujarat Kite Festival.[2] The film,
        which also had Murali making a special appearance, released in August
        2010 with critics mostly praising his debut performance with Sify.com
        writing he "makes a promising debut and he dances and emotes well".[3]
        Similarly a critic from Rediff.com added "romance is a cake-walk" for
        the actor, drawing comparison with his father's performances in romantic
        roles, though noted "his dialogue delivery is a little too
        melodramatic".[4] He subsequently gained recognition at the Edison
        Awards for Best Debut Actor, while also receiving a nomination from the
        Vijay Awards in the same category. The success of the film prompted
        Murali to begin pre-production on a Tamil and Kannada bilingual film
        which would feature Atharvaa.[5] However, a month after Baana Kaathadi's
        release, his father Murali died after suffering cardiac arrest. Atharvaa
        consequently took a break to spend time with his family, before
        beginning work on a different venture.
